PRACE Summer of HPC project newsletter report in popular science format that should be 2-3 pages long with graphics. The target audience is an educated adult, without scientific education in the field of the project. The report should contain a title, abstract, references and acknowledgements. 
% http://ctan.ijs.si/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt
\vspace{13\baselineskip} % we enforce space here for figure in right column
The report should cover an introduction, methods, results and conclusions but does not have to contain these as section headings. Tone should be more informal than a journal article. Your enthusiasm should show.

\section{Introduction}
\section{Methods}
\section{Results}
\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}

You can use your blog posts as a basis for this report. 

Graphics should be your own. Short title should be just few words. Highlight word or two to give some separation within the short title. Long name preceding short title is not necessarily the title of your project as facts about the projects, mentors and the author(s) are given at the end. Usually in magazines no two articles are the same in terms of formatting. You are free to do figure positioning and column spans. Bear in mind that with multiple columns spanning in \LaTeX is non-trivial.
\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{l}[\columnwidth+\columnsep]{1.3\columnwidth}
  \color{yellow}\rule{\linewidth}{3cm}\color{black}
  %\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig1}
  \caption{Use \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/wrapfig}{WrapFig} only if you are wrapping a text around the figure that flows on more that one column. See \href{http://ctan.ijs.si/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wrapfig/multiple-span.txt}{instructions} on how to find breaking point on each column. Note that captions are not preferred.}
  \label{fig:myfig1}
\end{wrapfigure}
\noindent Example nearby shows how wrapfig can be used for spanning into two columns. Don't be afraid of large screenshots. To get an idea on the style take a look into PRACE digest, newsletter and other popular scientific texts available on Internet. Google for \highlight{writing popular scientific}. For example: \url{http://awelu.srv.lu.se/genres-and-text-types/writing-in-academic-genres/popular-science-writing/}

\section*{Paper format}
We use A4 paper size with 10pt Charter or Georgia font. Text at the end and captions should be 9pt. Short title Helvetica (Arial) medium or light 45pt with 50pt spacing. Long title and Abstract 12pt. Margins should be 12mm everywhere except ob the bottom where 0.75 inch is reserved for page number. Other important dimensions: 
\begin{description}
  \item[column separation]  \the\columnsep
  \item[column width] \the\columnwidth
  \item[textwidth] \the\textwidth
\end{description}
For compiling \LaTeX it is recommended (if having troubles) to use latest \TeX live distribution. Use pdf\LaTeX instead of classical \LaTeX as it outputs PDF directly, wraps URLs correctly and can include PNG files directly. Do not use JPEG for screenshots! JPEG is for photos only. For sketching use \href{http://www.inkscape.org}{Inkscape}. 

\section*{General guidelines}
\newcommand{\itempar}[1]{\noindent\highlight{\textsf #1}\par\noindent}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt plus 3pt}\setlength{\topsep}{0pt plus 4pt}
  \setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item All articles should be in English.
\item Articles should be a maximum of 3 pages.
\item All articles should contain at least 2 images.
\end{itemize}

\itempar{Who Am I writing for?}This article should be in the style of a popular science article. This means that is should be relatively simple to understand and entertaining. 


\noindent The audience are not specialists in the field in questions, but rather interested laypeople. Adapt your content to the level of general knowledge of an educated adult who is not a computer scientist or scientist in your field Let your enthusiasm for your project show! Explain terms well. 

\noindent Use vivid language. Use illustrations, graphics and examples.

\itempar{Formatting}%
Final formatting will consist of a three column article 2-3 pages long. Please follow the formatting in the templates. Please provide links to hi-res version of any images submitted.

\itempar{Title}%
This should succinctly describe the content of the article. Be descriptive!
%

The title should be at the top of your first page and centred.
Do not use a title page.
%Headings with an asterisk(*) must be included

\itempar{Content}%
The following is the suggested content of the article. You do not have to include section heading to match, but should match the general flow and content.

\itempar{Author}
Author's names and institutional affiliation at the end.

\itempar{Abstract -- What did I do - in brief}  An abstract is a one-paragraph summary of the entire article. It should describe the question/problem or research topic addressed in the project and the methods used to answer or explore this area. It should highlight the important parts of the article. This is easiest to write once you have completed the rest of the article. Include a sentence summarising the introduction, methods, results and discussion section. The abstract should not contain citations. Equations should be avoided if possible. And not numbered if not referenced in text. 

\itempar{Introduction -- What is the project?}%
The introduction should describe the question/problem/research area addressed by the project and set the context for your work. It should explain why your project is interesting or important. It should introduce the techniques and approach you used to complete the project.

\itempar{Methods -- How did I complete the project?}%
Briefly describe what was actually done. This should include more detail on techniques and approaches, with enough detail that an interested person could attempt to reproduce your work (You do not have to include every detail, but use citations to give the required background). 

\itempar{Results -- What did I find out?}%
Focus on what worked! Outline the outcomes and results of your project

\itempar{Discussion \& Conclusion}
(What does that mean?) Explain your conclusions and your interpretation of your results. How did it compare to what was to be expected or previous work? What implications does this have for other work?

\itempar{References} (what work did I reference?)

\itempar{Acknowledgements} (who helped me?) PRACE acknowledgement will be given together at the colophon. Site acknowledgement if required. Other acknowledgement if requested.

\subsection*{Tables and Figures}
%Strange why the following macro needs to be repeated due to multicolinterrupt
%\newcommand{\itempar}[1]{\noindent\highlight{\textsf #1}\par\noindent}

Week 3 plans are given separately and contain the following items:

\itempar{Workplan} Please append and up-to-date workplan (Week 3 reports) outlining what you did week by week. Introduction can be used for final report too.

\itempar{Appendices} (Extra information)
Optional --- anything else you want to include, but not publish

\itempar{Award statement}%
Please amend a section to ``Week 3 plans'' at end of the programme stating why you think you should win
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The HPC Ambassador Award.
  \item The Best Visualisation Award.
\end{enumerate}
Information given as an update will be used to aid reviewers in evaluation of the projects and will not be publicly available.



\subsection*{Tables and Figures}

All tables and figures should be captioned. All tables and figures should be put into context in the text. Give your main figure instead of SoHPC logo figure nearby the title. Tables and figures should sequentially numbered. Make sure that there isn't a page break in the middle. Sometimes it is easier to add more text to get good balancing between columns.



\itempar{Acronyms, technical terms}%
Symbols, abbreviations and acronyms should be defined the first time they are used and then used consistently from there on. Note that too technical slang is not desired here.


\begin{table}[H]
 \caption{Random table}
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{llr}

%\noindent Answers to the questions of general interest will be published at the page \url{http://trac.lecad.fs.uni-lj.si/sohpc/wiki/template} where also all template files are available for download.

\section*{Videos and final presentations}
We recommend that videos are prepared in \href{https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171}{720p HD resolution} (19:6). Screen casts can be recorded by \href{http://atomisystems.com/activepresenter/free-edition/}{Active Presenter --  free edition}.

It is advisable that you prepare a text that you will be recording along with the presentation.\vspace{50mm} For quick check of how recording goes try the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
 \item Enter Full Motion Recording (FMR).
 \item Select Custom resolution (1280x720) and portion of screen you will be capturing.
\item Disable Floating Toolbar (bottom left).
\item Unmute microphone on the desktop.
\end{enumerate}
Once a capture has finished, one can:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Edit the capture (Cut, delete, copy, part of the captured video)
  \item Insert text, shapes, spotlights, higlight boxes, images
  \item Other elements possible.
  \item Each added feature appears in the timeline and you can edit for how long it will appear, where it will appear and how it will appear/disappear through transitions
  \item Position of these can also be altered to give a sense of ``animation''.
  \item Export it into MP4 or AVI format.
\end{itemize}
There are many other ways to record a screen and edit such as \href{http://geekthis.net/blog/98/virtualbox-video-capture}{VirtualBox screen recording} and \href{https://youtu.be/WDh1CrL2344}{Windows Movie Maker}. For video encoding one can use \href{http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html}{Super~\copyright} or similar software. Please visit examples of \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhpKvYInDmFWy66381nifGkCJBLb6iwGf}{SoHPC 2016 videos} on Youtube.


\section*{Section 1}
Section names should not be too technical. No numbering should be used. Sections can be even questions for the text that follows. Section names can state the fact explained in continuation.
